# codewars
Daily codewars challenges completed as a part of my software engineering training at @100Devs.

In the JS folder is js/main.js, which is used to create my algorithms to be tested on the console
in Google Chrome. Once the challenge is completed, the current js/main.js is moved
into the folder with a corresponding date of completion and js/main.js is used for the next
day's work.

Each daily challenge is listed with the date, title of the challenge. Test conditions to be satisfied
are also included.
